# QuizBoard
Getting Started
For this project to be executed, you will need internet and a browser in order to log onto the page.

Behavior Driven Development
The program prompts the the user to select only one option, in that if the user tries to select more options in a single question the previously selected option will be deselected.

The program has no restrictions on which option to select, any option can be selected but points & or marks will be awarded for correct options only.

The form will only be submitted if all the questions are answered
